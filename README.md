# About
Implementation of a mini shell program in C as a group project of 2 in the 42 school core curriculum.  
We implemented a bash like behaviour with |, <, >, <<, >>, and '' and "".  
The shell has builtins like echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit.  
Also we implemented signals, environment variables and exit codes.  
The shell can run headless.  

# Usage

```
make
./minishell
```

# Thanks to
